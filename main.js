//For modules you create another JS file and use export default on the main class and export on the functions as a prefix
//To import these modules you would for example say import User from '/user.js' if the default class was User
//Another way shown in MDN web docs is export { name, draw, reportArea, reportPerimeter }; on the module and import { name, draw, reportArea, reportPerimeter } from './modules/square.js'; in the JS file
