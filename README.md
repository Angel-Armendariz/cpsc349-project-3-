The parameters of the project are to work with HTML, CSS, and vanilla JavaScript. We are required to write 3 NPM script in order to start Browsersync for testing, validate HTML with vnu checker and JavaScript standard styling checker, and a script for running Tailwind CLI. The web server involved should not generate HTML dynamically or provide a backend API. The code must have a single HTML file that is valid, JavaScript that uses JavaScript Standard Styling, no inline styles or style attributes other than Tailwind CSS, no inline scripts or inline event handlers, all JS must be loaded from a module, the game state must be saved using Window.localStorage, no third part JS libraries or fetching data from a server but built in Client-side web APIs are allowed.
